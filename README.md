# **Rock Paper Scissors Project**

## **About** 
A Rock Paper Scissors game created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript
The game features a responsive scoreboard updating everytime a round is played
alongside a computer enemy to play against. The buttons corresponding to
rock, paper, or scissors may be clicked to play a move.

## **Project Outcomes** 
### *First Iteration*  
The first iteration of this project was just a simple implementation
of the Rock Paper Scissors game into the browser console.

### *Second Iteration*
The second iteration of this project was implementing interactable elements
in the webpage so that the user can play the game. Thus, I created elements
such as a scoreboard, a selection button, and a game view to make the game.

## **TAKEAWAYS**
- I tried to **maintain readable and clean code**
- Built upon my **knowledge of Javascript** (scopes, DOM manipulation, <br/>
Event Listeners..)
- I practiced my **CSS Skills** and deepened my knowledge of CSS capabilities <br/>
(Flexbox, Box Model, Specificity, Selectors)
